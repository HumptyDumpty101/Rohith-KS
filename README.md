## Problems Overview

### Problem 1: Class-Based Calculator
Simple class-based calculator with input validation for zero division.

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Initiate a class object
const calc = new Calculator();

// Perform Operations
const result = calc.calculate(10, 5, '+');
```

### Problem 2: First N Odd Numbers
Simple function to log first N odd numbers with input validation for valid postive numbers.

### Problem 3: Conditional Odd Numbers
Variation of Problem 2 - if input is even, only print up to first N-1 odd numbers.

### Problem 4: Digit Multiples Counter
Simple program to find count of multiples of digits 1-9 in the input array.

**Note:** In case the requirement of count of multiples is larger than 1-9, we will have to find another algorithm to improve time complexity.
